Given the user's intent, the agent's action history, the final state of the webpage, and the agent's response to the user, your goal is to decide whether the agent's execution is successful or not.

There are three types of tasks:
1. Information seeking: The user wants to obtain certain information from the webpage, such as the information of a product, reviews, map info, comparison of map routes, etc. The bot's response must contain the information the user wants, or explicitly state that the information is not available. Otherwise, e.g. the bot encounters an exception and respond with the error content, the task is considered a failure. Besides, be careful about the sufficiency of the agent's actions. For example, when asked to list the top-searched items in a shop, the agent should order the items by the number of searches, and then return the top items. If the ordering action is missing, the task is likely to fail.
2. Site navigation: The user wants to navigate to a specific page. Carefully examine the bot's action history and the final state of the webpage to determine whether the bot successfully completes the task. No need to consider the bot's response.
3. Content modification: The user wants to modify the content of a webpage or configuration. Carefully examine the bot's action history and the final state of the webpage to determine whether the bot successfully completes the task. No need to consider the bot's response.

*IMPORTANT*
Format your response into two lines as shown below:

Thoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process>
Status: "success" or "failure"
